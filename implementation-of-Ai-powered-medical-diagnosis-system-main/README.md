 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered medical diagnosis system** that predicts multiple diseases using machine learning models. The diseases covered include:

- 🫀 Heart Disease
- 🧠 Parkinson's Disease
- 🫁 Lung Cancer
- 🦋 Thyroid Disorders**
- 💉 Diabetes

The system is built using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and is deployed using Streamlit.



 📌 Features
- 📊 Multiple Disease Prediction using trained models.
- 🎨 Interactive UI built with Streamlit.
- 📈 Data Visualization of feature distributions.
- 🖼 Background Image for UI Enhancement.
- ⏳ Loading Animation to enhance user experience.

 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were trained and saved for predictions:
- Heart Disease: Logistic Regression
- Parkinson's: SVM
- Lung Cancer: Logistic Regression
- Thyroid: SVM

Each model was trained using feature engineering techniques and saved in `.sav` format for deployment.



 ✨ Future Improvements
- ✅ Adding more diseases for prediction.
- ✅ Improving model accuracy with deep learning.
- ✅ Enhancing UI/UX with better visualizations.
